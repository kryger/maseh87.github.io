As my first blog topic I want to cover how I decided to start my blog and what steps I used to get there.

There are a ton of different ways to start your own blog. I mean a ton. I decided that I want people to view my blog but I want to be able to host it without paying anything. I did some research and found that you can use GitHub <-- to host your site for free. To get started visit the GitHub Pages website <--, follow the instructions and you will have a hosted website in no time.

After I hosted my site on GitHub I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time designing and filling in the blanks so I decided to find a pre-made theme to help speed up the process. This is where it can get a little confusing, so i'll explain it in detail on how I got mine to work properly.

The theme I decided to use is called the Hipster Jekyll Theme. <-- I forked the theme from GitHub and cloned it inside of my site folder on my computer. <-- (use link to github basics)
