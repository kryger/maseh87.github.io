I made my decision to learn software engineering less than a year ago for a few reasons. I wanted to get overpaid for sitting on my ass and I wanted the unreal benefits at working in the startup community. My original plans to obtain those goals were to get accepted into a school called Hack Reactor in San Francisco, slip through the cracks and be good enough to get a software engineering job and never worry again. Those plans changed very quickly.

I first want to point out that I am no genius. I BARELY made it through high school and tried my hand at a few college classes and failed about 90 percent of them. I have a very difficult time with school in general so needless to say trying to get into the most elite programming bootcamps was nothing short of crazy, not to mention at the time I was a single father of a 7 year old and 2000 miles away from any family in San Diego.

After studying for a week or so I got my first interview for Hack Reactor and blew it. He knew right off the bat I wasn't the right fit for the school. Being the egotist that I am I thought that I he screwed me over and hassled the school for another shot at an interview. I got another interview a few days later and I messed up even worse. This time I got so nervous I froze up and couldn't speak. That was the biggest blow to my self esteem. That interview sparked a flame inside of me that can never be extinguished. From that moment I made it my goal to get into the school not for my original goals but because I was going to prove to them that I was good enough to be accepted there.

I wanted to get in so bad that I quit my job and moved to San Francisco and somehow weaseled my way into getting a part time job at the very school I wasn't good enough to be a student at. I wanted all the exposure to programming that I could get my hands on to become someone that I wasn't. After 4 months of working at the school and studying in my off time I decided to apply again. I had so much confidence this time around I wasn't worried about anything. Long story short I failed that interview. After all that time and effort I still couldn't prove I was good enough to be accepted. I remember thinking after I failed that interview that they are going to get so tired of my applying that they will just let me in so I would leave them alone. As my interviewer was telling me how I did I practically begged him for another opportunity. It worked and I scheduled another interview for 2 weeks later.

2 weeks passed and I studied my ass off for this interview. I thought I covered it all, well when I got there and was told what problem we were going to do it was like a slap to the face. He pulled something out of his hat that I never seen before and I wanted to cry when I started typing. Take a guess at what happened? Yep I screwed up again. My issue wasn't with my javascript knowledge it was with how fast I can grasp new concepts. They found my weakness and ripped me apart. That was the real shot to my ego. I felt like I was really too dumb to become a software engineer. 2 weeks later I recieved a letter from the school and they extended me an offer to participate in half of the class. They did have enough trust that I could learn≈ì
