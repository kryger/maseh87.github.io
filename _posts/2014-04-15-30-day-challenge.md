I have been programming for a little over 6 months and despite making great progress I feel that I can do more. A tricky part of programming is to realizing when you aren't making any forward progress in your work. By saying forward progress I mean writing code that is relevant to anything, contributing to some sort of project or creating something at all. It is very easy to get caught up in researching and not getting back to what you were searching for in the first place. After spending too many hours one night researching a few problems, I closed my laptop at about 2 in the morning with absolutely no code to show for it. So I decided to change my way of working...

I stumbled on a blog site from a guy name John Resig and one post is about writing code everyday. If you don't know who John Resig is he is the creator of a little thing called Jquery. Needless to say but if he has advice I am gonna take it. You can read his article [here](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/).

I am gonna challenge myself to the same thing for 30 days. I am going to follow basically the same rules he had.

  1. I must write code every day. I can write docs, or blog posts, or other things but it must be in addition to the code that I write.
  2. It must be useful code. No tweaking indentation, no code re-formatting, and if at all possible no refactoring. (All these things are permitted, but not as the exclusive work of the day.)
  3. All code must be written before midnight.
  4. The code must be Open Source and up on Github.

Sounds pretty simple. Follow me for 30 days and see how I progress.
